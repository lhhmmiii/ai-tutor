  ## Grammar explanation
  enough means 'as much as necessary'. It can be used with an adjective, an adverb, a verb or a noun. It can also act as a pronoun.
  ### With adjectives and adverbs
  enough comes after adjectives and adverbs.
    I'm not tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Your marks are good enough to study engineering at university.
I couldn't write quickly enough and I ran out of time.
I've helped at conferences often enough to know what can go wrong.
  ### With verbs
  enough comes after verbs.
    I make sure I drink enough during the day.
I don't read enough but I'm going to start downloading books to my phone.
  ### With nouns
  enough comes before nouns.
    There isn't enough bread to make sandwiches.
Have you got enough money?
  ### As a pronoun
  enough can also be used without a noun.
    I'll get some more chairs. There aren't enough.
A: Do you want more coffee? B: No, I've had enough, thanks.
  We know what the noun is because of the context.
  ### With an adjective and a noun
  When enough is used with an adjective and a noun, two positions are possible but the meaning changes.
    We haven't got big enough envelopes. 
We haven't got enough big envelopes.
  When enough is after the adjective (big enough envelopes), it describes the adjective â€“ the envelopes are too small. When enough is before the adjective (enough big envelopes), it describes the noun phrase â€“ we have some big envelopes, but we need more.
  ### enough of
  We normally only use enough of when it is followed by a determiner or a pronoun (a/an/the, this/that, my/your/his, you/them, etc.).
    There isn't enough of that bread to make sandwiches for everyone.
I've seen enough of his work to be able to recommend him.
There's enough of us to make a difference.

          Hello Sandy Nguyen,
          The rule for using enough is as follows: enough comes before a noun (enough time, enough beauty, enough money) but after an adjective (good enough, foolish enough, beautiful enough). That should give you the answer to your question.

            Thank you for your help,
            I think 2 sentences are right about grammar structure,
            The town is known for having natural enough beauty to captivate anyone who visits.
            The town is known for having enough natural beauty to captivate anyone who visits.
            like examples We haven't got big enough envelopes. 
                       We haven't got enough big envelopes.
            But someone says "The town is known for having natural enough beauty to captivate anyone who visits " is not correct. Can you explain to me?

              Hello Sandy Nguyen,
              The question is which word 'enough' applies to in the sentence. If you say enough natural beauty then you are saying there is some natural beauty but there needs to be more. If you say natural enough beauty you are saying that there is beauty but it needs to be more natural. Since it's hard to make a town's beauty 'more natural' I think the first answer is clearly the right option.

        For the first time I found the lesson quite easy. The use of enough is enough similar to Italian :)

        The phrase "enough" is used in various contexts to express adequacy, sufficiency, or the point at which something is considered satisfactory. Here are a few common uses:
        - Quantity or Amount:
"We have enough food for everyone." (sufficient quantity)
"That's enough water for now." (sufficient amount)
        - Extent or Degree:
"She is strong enough to lift it." (sufficient strength)
"It's warm enough to go outside without a jacket." (sufficient warmth)
        - Limit or Tolerance:
"Enough is enough!" (indicating that a limit has been reached)
"I've had enough of this noise!" (expressing that one can no longer tolerate something)
        - As an Adjective or Adverb:
"Heâ€™s rich enough to buy the car." (adjective indicating sufficiency in wealth)
"She didnâ€™t run fast enough." (adverb indicating the degree of speed)
        - As a Noun:
"Iâ€™ve had enough." (referring to the state of being sufficient or satisfactory)
        "Enough" is versatile and its meaning is often determined by the context in which it is used.

        The use of "enough to" in the following excerpt from the Cambridge dictionary is not explained in this grammar section:
"In the final straight Meyers stumbled, and although he didn't fall it was enough to lose him first place."
        What would make more sense to me is, for example, "it was enough to make him lose first place", but the structure featured above sounds weird to me.

          Hi yalvar,
          The structure in that example is: lose + [somebody] + [something]. Here are some more examples: My mistakes in the interview lost me the job. The government's failed policy lost them public support. The captain's red card lost his team the championship. It's the final structure listed under meaning 4 here, from the Longman Dictionary.
          That isn't the only possible structure after "lose". Your sentence is also grammatical!
