  ## Grammar explanation
  Relative clauses give us information about the person or thing mentioned.
  Defining relative clauses give us essential information – information that tells us who or what we are talking about.
    The woman who lives next door works in a bank. 
These are the flights that have been cancelled.
  We usually use a relative pronoun or adverb to start a defining relative clause: who, which, that, when, where or whose.
  ### who/that
  We can use who or that to talk about people. that is more common and a bit more informal.
    She's the woman who cuts my hair.
He's the man that I met at the conference.
  ### which/that
  We can use which or that to talk about things. that is more common and a bit more informal.
    There was a one-year guarantee which came with the TV.
The laptop that I bought last week has started making a strange noise!
  ### Other pronouns
  when can refer to a time.
    Summer is the season when I'm happiest.
  where can refer to a place.
    That's the stadium where Real Madrid play.
  whose refers to the person that something belongs to.
    He's a musician whose albums have sold millions.
  ### Omitting the relative pronoun
  Sometimes we can leave out the relative pronoun. For example, we can usually leave out who, which or that if it is followed by a subject.
    The assistant [that] we met was really kind.
   (we = subject, can omit that)
  We can't usually leave it out if it is followed by a verb.
    The assistant that helped us was really kind.
   (helped = verb, can't omit that)

        Hello Sir,
        Can we combine two defining relative clause as mentioned below?
        For people who enjoy reading while traveling and who want to access multiple books, e-book reader is a perfect option.
        Is there any particular rule that we should follow when combining them?
        Thank you

          Hello FathimaFrk,
          Yes, you can do that. Your sentence is fine apart from lacking an article: an e-book reader is...

          Hello yousifzz._.,
          That question is the last question in the task. The reason it says there are items remaining is that you can choose more than one answer for each question. For example, for some questions both 'which' and 'that' are possible, so you should choose both answers and not only one. As the rubric for the task says: "Choose all the correct options".

        Dear, here is one more question: when we use “which” instead of “why”, do we use both “in/on/at which” and “which…..in/on/at” Many thanks.

          Hello KatherineThu,
          You can replace the relative adverbs why, where and when with which and a pronoun. The pronoun depends on the original sentence and, yes, it can be before the relative pronoun or at the end of the clause:
          I visited the house where she lives > I visited the house in which she lives / I visited the house which she lives in
          We met on the day when I graduated > We met on the day on which I graduated > We met on the day which I graduated on
          That's the reason why she did it > That's the reason for which she did it > That's the reason which she did it for

        Dear,
        Need I change “a” into “the” in a relative clause?
        They ate at a restaurant. It serves only vegan dishes=> They ate at a restaurant which serves only vegan dishes.
        or
        They ate at a restaurant which serves only vegan dishes.
        Many thanks 💌

          Hello KatherineThu,
          Your sentences are identical! I presume you meant to change 'a restaurant' to 'the restaurant'.
          There is no need to change the article in the relative clause. You would only use 'the' if both the speaker and the listener know which restaurant you mean, which is clearly not the case here as it is the first time the speaker is referencing it.

          Hello amitagnihotri585,
          Yes, that is correct -- well done! It would also be correct to say 'I politely request that my election duty be cancelled'.
          Best wishes,
Kirk
