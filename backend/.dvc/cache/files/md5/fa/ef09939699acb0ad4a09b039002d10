  ## Grammar explanation
  'Inversion' means reversing (inverting) the normal subjectâ€“verb word order in a sentence.
  We can use inversion to add emphasis, especially in formal English. It is common, for example, in political speeches, because it has a persuasive and impressive effect.
  To invert a sentence in this way, we put the adverbial (e.g. never, rarely, not only, etc.) at the beginning and change the normal position of the subject and the auxiliary verb.
    Not only did they arrive late but they talked throughout the film. 
(They not only arrived late but they talked throughout the film.)
  If there is no auxiliary verb, we need to add one. For example, we add do for present simple verbs and did for past simple verbs.
    Rarely do we find such talent. 
(We rarely find such talent.)
  ### Never, rarely, seldom
  These adverbials are often used with present perfect, past perfect or modals like can and could.
    Never had they seen so many people in the village.
Seldom has she taken a day off work.
Rarely can a patient fully recover from such an injury.
  ### Hardly, barely, scarcely, no sooner
  These adverbials often refer to an event which quickly follows another in the past and are usually used with past perfect. Hardly, scarcely and barely are followed by when in the contrasting clause, and no sooner is followed by than.
    Hardly had we sat down when we were told to evacuate the building.
Scarcely had the votes been counted when the new president was pushed in front of TV cameras.
No sooner had the game started than the captain was taken ill.
No sooner was the new park open than it started raining.
  ### Only + time expression
  These include only after, only if/when, only then and only later.
    Only when they refilled my glass did I realise it was broken.
Only later did they discover they hadn't been told the truth.
  ### Phrases with no and not
  These include under no circumstances, on no account, at no time, in no way, on no condition, not until and not only.
    Under no circumstances should children travel without an adult.
In no way did we agree to this.
  ### Little
  In these sentences, little has a negative or restrictive meaning.
    Little do people realise how hard it is to be a chef.
(People don't realise how hard it is to be a chef.)
Little did she know then that she would become the company director.  
(She didn't know then that she would become the company director.)

          Hello Simonka,
          That's right. On the page we say that no sooner and similar forms are usually used with past perfect. Usually does not mean always, and this is an example of a sentence which does not use past perfect.

        Hi Teachers,
        I would like this sentence "they assume that never would their grip on Algeria was secure if they did not hold it", why the word "was" here was wrong after negative adverb inversion and what should replace it ? thank you

          Hi semdavidtimothy,
          The normal sentence (without inversion) is as follows:
          they assume that their grip on Algeria would never be secure if they did not hold it
          Inversion occurs with the would be verb phrase, giving us this:
          they assume that never would their grip on Algeria be secure if they did not hold it
          I don't think this is a very natural construction, however, though it is grammatically possible. The reason is that we tend not to use inversion after verbs expressing belief, hope, expectation and so on. Assume falls into this category.

        Hello
        I have a doubt with these sentences, are they well written? do they mean the same?:
        - Under no circumstances should you ride that horse.
        - Under no circumstances are you allowed to ride that horse.
        Thank you

          Hello danielcanton,
          Yes, both of those sentences are correct. Well done!
          The meanings are similar but the first (with should) gives strong advice whereas the second (with allowed to) describes a prohibition or rule.

          Hello khrysty7na,
          Yes, that's correct. It describes (complains about) a frequent or repeated situation.
          Well done.

        Hello there!
        I have a question about sentence 5 grammar test 1.
        Could you explain me please why shouldn't we use an inversion in this sentence like in the others.
        "Only when had we heard they'd arrived safely could we relax"
        Thank you!

          Hi LikTo,
          There is inversion in this sentence but it is later:
            Only when we had heard they'd arrived safely could we relax.
          Could we is the inverted part here. I think the confusion comes from how long the introductory clause is. If you replace it with something shorter (like a single word!) then the construction becomes clear:
            Only then could we relax.
          You don't need any inversion in the introductory clause, only in the main clause.
