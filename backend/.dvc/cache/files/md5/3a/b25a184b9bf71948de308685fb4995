  ## Grammar explanation
  We often use just, yet, still and already with the present perfect because they are related to the present moment. This page focuses on the meaning and use of these words when they are used with the present perfect.
  ### just
  Just used with the present perfect means 'a short time before'.
    I've just seen Susan coming out of the cinema.
Mike's just called. Can you ring him back, please?
Have you just taken my pen?!
  Just comes between the auxiliary verb (have/has) and the past participle.
  ### yet
  Yet used with the present perfect means 'at any time up to now'. We use it to emphasise that we expect something to happen soon. Yet (in this context) is only used in negative sentences and questions.
    Have you finished your homework yet?
I haven't finished it yet. I'll do it after dinner.
A. Where's Sam? B: He hasn't arrived yet.
  Yet comes at the end of the sentence or question.
  ### still
  Still used with the present perfect means that something hasn't happened. We use it to emphasise that we expected the thing to happen earlier. Still (in this context) is only used in negative sentences.
    I've been waiting for an hour and the bus still hasn't come.
They promised me that report yesterday but they still haven't finished it.
She still hasn't replied to my email. Maybe she's on holiday.
  Still comes between the subject (the bus, they, etc.) and auxiliary verb (haven't/hasn't).
  ### already
  Already used with the present perfect means 'before now'. We use it to emphasise that something happened before something else or earlier than expected.
    I've already spent my salary and it's two weeks before payday.
He wanted to see Sudden Risk but I've already seen it.
The train's left already!
  Already can come between the auxiliary and the main verb or at the end of the clause.

          Hello Khangvo2812,
          Generally, we use the present perfect (I have moved in) when an action in the past (moving in) has a present result or effect (here I am/I'm your new neighbour). We use the past simple (I moved in) when an action is solely in the past without any present echo.
          However, for very recent actions in the past with just there is a difference in British and American English. British English speakers tend to use the present perfect with just while American speakers often us the past simple instead. I would say that that is the main difference here. A British English speaker would choose the second sentence, while an American English speaker would be more likely to choose the first.
          You can read more about the present perfect and past simple here:

        Hi, team! Can you please clarify why we use "yet" and present perfect tense (we have been to the restaurant...) in the last sentence? As far as i know "yet" mostly used in negetive and questions with present perfect tense.
The context is following:
B: I ate sushi for the first time on my dad's 50th birthday. He invited the whole family to a Japanese restaurant.
A: Did you like it?
B: Absolutely. In fact, it was so good that we have been to that restaurant three times yet. And on my mum's birthday, we ordered some sushi and had it at home.

          Hello Babanova,
          That does not look like a correct use of 'yet' to me. I would use 'already' or 'since then'.

        Hello,
I think your website is good but it's better to have more practices and tests because for example when we've just studied grammer,we need many perfect tests and challenge to overcome over the grammer subject.
We also need advance grammer , if you could add to this site,please.
Thank you

          Hello mr_bahrami2011,
          Thanks for your feedback. There are quite a few advanced grammar points covered in our English grammar reference. There are also usually more exercises on those pages.
          I'm also pleased to say that we are working on a C1 grammar and hope to publish it here soon.
          You might also want to consider some of the options in our Online courses section if you'd like more in-depth work.
          All the best,
Kirk

          Hello samayullah,
          We're glad you found LearnEnglish!
          Most of our site has worksheets, but I'm afraid our Grammar and Vocabulary sections do not. One day we'd like to create them, but at the moment it's simply too much work for our small team.
          All the best,
Kirk

        Hi there,
I hope you are fine, and doing well. I, personally, think that this is the best website for English learners. However, I have a feedback which is what if you share a video with the grammar lessons, this way I think we will better learn each lesson.
