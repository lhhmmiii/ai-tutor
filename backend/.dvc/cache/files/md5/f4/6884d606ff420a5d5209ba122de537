  ## Grammar explanation
  Nouns can be countable or uncountable. Countable nouns can be counted, e.g. an apple, two apples, three apples, etc. Uncountable nouns cannot be counted, e.g. air, rice, water, etc. When you learn a new noun, you should check if it is countable or uncountable and note how it is used in a sentence.
  ### Countable nouns
  For positive sentences we can use a/an for singular nouns or some for plurals.
    There's a man at the door.
I have some friends in New York.
  For negatives we can use a/an for singular nouns or any for plurals.
    I don't have a dog.
There aren't any seats.
  ### Uncountable nouns
  Here are some examples of uncountable nouns:
          bread
          rice
          coffee
          information
          money
          advice
          luggage
          furniture
  We use some with uncountable nouns in positive sentences and any with negatives.
    There's some milk in the fridge.
There isn't any coffee.
  ### Questions
  In questions we use a/an, any or how many with countable nouns.
    Is there an email address to write to?
Are there any chairs?
How many chairs are there?
  And we use any or how much with uncountable nouns.
    Is there any sugar?
How much orange juice is there?
  But when we are offering something or asking for something, we normally use some.
    Do you want some chocolate?
Can we have some more chairs, please?
  We also use some in a question when we think the answer will be 'yes'.
    Have you got some new glasses?
  ### Other expressions of quantity
  A lot of (or lots of) can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns.
    There are lots of apples on the trees.
There is a lot of snow on the road.
  Notice that we don't usually use many or much in positive sentences. We use a lot of instead.
    They have a lot of money.
  However, in negative sentences we use not many with countable nouns and not much with uncountable nouns.
    There are a lot of carrots but there aren't many potatoes.
There's lots of juice but there isn't much water.

          Hello Harshi11,
          Chocolate can be countable or uncountable. If you think of the substance then it is uncountable:
          I love chocolate.
          Do you have any chocolate?
          If you think of individual sweets in a box, for example, then it is countable:
          I got a box of chocolates for my birthday.
          Would you like a chocolate? The ones in red wrappers are milk and the ones in blue wrappers are dark chocolate.
          There are many words that function in this way, especially food and drink such coffee, tea, pizza and cocoa.

            Hello richace,
            Drinking chocolate can also be either countable (a cup of chocolate) or not, just like cocao.

        Hi! Why is that the given question uses "is there" but the answer uses "are there"?
        For example:
        Question: How much milk is there?
        Answer: There are two glasses of milk.

          Hi Cath,
          It all depends on the noun used.
          In the question the noun is milk, which is an uncountable noun and so we use 'there is', just as we do for all uncountable nouns.
          In the answer the noun is 'glasses (of milk)'. Now we have a countable noun which is plural and so we use 'there are'.
          If the answer included just the uncountable noun 'milk' it would have 'there is':
            Question: How much milk is there?
            Answer: There is a lot of milk.
          If the answer included a countable noun which was singular we would also use 'there is':
            Question: How much milk is there?
            Answer: There is one glass of milk.

          Hey, if the object is uncountable such as milk, we use 'much' instead of 'many' and 'is' instead of 'are' because it is considered singular in this context. On the other hand, the answer is 'There are two glasses of milk' because Glasses are countable and p
