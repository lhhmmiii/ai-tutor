        Clarification on the Correct Usage of "Who" in WH Questions
        I need clarification regarding the correct usage of "Who" as a subject and as an object in WH questions. Could you please confirm the correctness of the following examples?
        ### Examples:
        Using "Who" with "I am":
        - Who is?
        - Who am I?
        Using "Who" with "I have":
        - Who has?
        - Who have?
        Using "Who" with "I do it.":
        - Who do it?
        - Who does it?
        ### Extended Examples:
        - "I am a student" → Who am I? / Who is a student?
        - "I have cars" → Who has cars? / Who have cars?
        - "I do not have cars" → Who does not have cars? / Who do not have cars?
        ### Additional Queries:
        - "I" is a singular subject, but it seems to take both singular and plural verbs (e.g., "I am" and "I do"). Are there other singular subjects that behave this way?
        - Is "am" the only singular verb used with "I"? Are there other singular verbs that work similarly with "I"?
        Could you confirm which of these questions are correct? Additionally, please provide explanations for the rules governing the use of "Who" as the subject and the object in WH questions.
        Thank you!

          Hello Prakash,
          This is a little longer than the questions we usually answer on the site. Please remember that we're a very small team here providing a free service to many thousands to users. It's difficult for us to answer questions like this due to the time constraints we have.
            Using "Who" with "I am":
            Who is?
Who am I?
          The second question is fine. The first would only be used to ask for clarification when we did not understand a reference made by someone else and not used in isolation. For example:
          He's an idiot.
          Who is?
          The guy driving the car in front of us.
            Using "Who" with "I have":
            Who has?
Who have?
          The same point applies here with regard to the usage of questions like this. Also, the singular form is much more common when forming questions with 'who'. It is possible to use a plural verb but we do it only when we are sure that we are talking about a group of people; if it is uncertain how many (one or more than one) then we prefer a singular verb.
            Using "Who" with "I do it.":
            Who do it?
Who does it?
          See the comment above.
            Extended Examples:
"I am a student" → Who am I? / Who is a student?
"I have cars" → Who has cars? / Who have cars?
"I do not have cars" → Who does not have cars? / Who do not have cars?
Additional Queries:
"I" is a singular subject, but it seems to take both singular and plural verbs (e.g., "I am" and "I do"). Are there other singular subjects that behave this way?
            Is "am" the only singular verb used with "I"? Are there other singular verbs that work similarly with "I"?
Could you confirm which of these questions are correct? Additionally, please provide explanations for the rules governing the use of "Who" as the subject and the object in WH questions.
          I always takes a singular verb - 'do' is a singular form for first and second person (I do / you do). The plural form for the first person is 'we'.
          Questions with 'be' are formed by inversion rather than with an auxiliary verb and the verb 'be' agrees with the complement whether singular or plural:
          Who am I? / Who are you? / Who is she? / Who are they? etc
          Where the complement is a noun rather than a pronoun 'who' takes the third person form, singular or plural:
          Who is the teacher? / Who are the teachers?

        Happy New Year Jonathan R, Kirk, Peter M.
        When learning English as a beginner, is it more effective to practice sentences with just the subject and verb (e.g., 'I do,' 'I have,' 'I am') to focus on conjugation, or should learners incorporate objects and context from the beginning (e.g., 'I do homework,' 'I have a car,' 'I am a student') for better understanding and application?

          Happy New Year to you too!
          I'm loathe to make general rules about the best way to teach different elements of English as there are too many variables: the students, their ages, their backgrounds, their existing knowledge, their goals, and the educational system in which they are learning (including exams and so on), to name but a few.
          That said, I do think teaching language as it is used in real contexts is wisest. Corpus-based linguistics and neurological research has shown that language is stored not as discrete items connected anew every time we use them, but rather in chunks ready for deployment and combination. The inference is that exposure to such chunks is both wise and necessary for effective language acquisition. In addition, by being exposed to chunks of language students pick up patterns relating to article use, word order, collocation and so on without being explicitly aware of them. They learn to make good guesses even if they don't know the reasons for them.
          I hope that helps somewhat.

        Hello sir. If in the same sentence we have two verbs, do we put them both in the same time?
        Like example:
        - I am trying to study.
        Do study verb come with (ing) ?

          Hello Farahmorgan,
          The sentence has a main verb (try) which is in the present continuous (am trying). This is followed by an infinitive (to study). You can read more about verb patterns like this on this page:

        Hello sir. Why is simple present "does not" used rather than "will not" in the sentence: "I assure you that I will take extra precautions to ensure that this kind of accident does not happen again in the future."?
        Is "will not" grammatically acceptable in this sentence?
        Thanks for your time.

          Hello Radioheady,
          After ensure (that) you can use present or a modal verb like will:
            I assure you that I will take extra precautions to ensure that this kind of accident does not happen again in the future.
            I assure you that I will take extra precautions to ensure that this kind of accident will not happen again in the future.
            I assure you that I will take extra precautions to ensure that this kind of accident cannot happen again in the future.
            I assure you that I will take extra precautions to ensure that this kind of accident is not going to happen again in the future.
          All of these forms describe future time. Ensure (that) and phrases with similar meanings like make sure (that) and guarantee (that) are very flexible in that way.
