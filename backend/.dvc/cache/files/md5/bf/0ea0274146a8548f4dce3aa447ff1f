  ## Grammar explanation
  The past continuous and the past simple help us to show how two past actions or situations are connected.
  ### Past simple
  The past simple shows us that an action was in the past, not in the present. Regular past simple verbs have -ed at the end (e.g. called, played, arrived). Irregular verbs have a different form, usually with a different vowel sound (e.g. wake → woke, break → broke, feel → felt).
    My parents called me yesterday.
I woke up early this morning.
Sam played basketball when he was at university.
  We make the negative with didn't and the infinitive verb.
    My parents didn't call me yesterday.
I didn't wake up early this morning.
  We make the question form with did and then the subject and infinitive verb.
    Did you wake up early this morning?
Did Sam play basketball when he was at university?
  ### Past continuous
  The past continuous shows us that the action was already in progress at a certain time in the past.
    What were you doing at 8 p.m. last night? I was studying.
  This means that I started studying before 8 p.m. and I continued after 8 p.m.
  The past continuous can also show that an activity was in progress for some time, not just for a moment.
    We were cleaning the house all morning.
  We make the past continuous with was or were and the -ing form of the verb.
    She couldn't come to the party. She was working.
Three years ago, we were living in my home town.
I tried to give him some advice, but he wasn't listening.
What were you doing this time last year?
  ### Past continuous and past simple
  When we use these two tenses together, it shows us that the past simple action happened in the middle of the past continuous action, while it was in progress.
    While I was studying, I suddenly felt sleepy.
  We often use these tenses to show an action interrupting another action.
    I broke my leg when I was skiing.
As I was going to work, I saw an old friend.
We were watching television when the power went off.
  Can you see a difference in the meaning of these two sentences?
    When the guests arrived, Jane was cooking dinner.
When the guests arrived, Jane cooked dinner.
  In the first one, Jane started cooking dinner before the guests arrived. We know that because it uses the past continuous. In the second sentence, the guests arrived first and then Jane started cooking.

          Hello Joy1010,
          The infinitive is the base form of the verb. It is sometimes use with 'to' before it and sometimes without 'to'. The infinitive is highlighted in these examples:
            I want to be a doctor.
            She helped me find my bag.
            You should go home.
            He doens't know know what to do.
          You can read more about the infinitive here:

        Hi everybody! I have a question about a sentence that appeared in the page.
        I broke my leg when I was skiing.
        I have learned we use 'while' with past continuous and 'when' with past simple but in the example we have When I was skiing. We are supposed to use While not when. PLEASE HELP
        I don't know what is the difference between while and when and if the sentence is correct I want to know why :( :(

          Hello _diazkv1308,
          It's true that while is most often used with continuous forms and when with simple forms but it's a tendency rather than a rule. While emphasises that an event happened during another, generally longer, event. When can mean this or it can mean that one event is triggered by another ('When she came home, I brought her a coffee'). While cannot be used in this way. Thus you can say that when and while can both be used for the first meaning, with while being more common, but only when can be used for the second meaning.
          You can read a discussion of the subject here:

          "I broke my leg when I was skiing."
          The sentence is correct, and here's why:
          - When we use when in a sentence like this, it refers to a specific moment in the past when something happened. It's often used with the past simple to describe an event that occurred suddenly or unexpectedly.
          - The phrase "I was skiing" is in the past continuous, which describes an action in progress at a particular time in the past. It sets the scene.
          - The action of breaking your leg is sudden and happens during that time, which is why we use when to mark that specific moment.
