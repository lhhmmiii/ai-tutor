          Hello NabilaELM,
          The correct preposition here is 'to', so you need to say 'He went to a new school in London'.
          The verb 'go' can be followed by 'into' when talking about physical entry, such as going into a building. When you want to say someone is a part of an educational institution we use 'go to': go to school, go to college, go to the British Council, go to yoga classes etc.

        Hello team,
        I would be grateful if you could help me with the below.
        According to dictionary.cambridge.org,
        We use "at":
        To refer to activities which involve a group of people:
        Eg.
        Were you at Lisa's party? ( also "at the cinema, at the theatre" )
        Does the above mean saying "IN the cinema" and
        "INSIDE the cinema" are wrong?
        Thanks

          Hello Yornis,
          They are not wrong but they have different meanings. Generally, in and inside describe physical locations within a structure such as a building or similar. When you say 'in the cinema' or 'inside the cinema' you are talking about being within the building. When you say 'at the cinema' you are expressing a broader meaning which suggests going to watch a film.

        Hello team,
        I would be grateful if you could help me with the below:
        He jumped INTO the rIver. (Certainly correct)
        He threw fruits INTO the rIver. (Certainly correct)
        My question is :   Can we use "in" instead of "into" for the above two as shown below:
        (1) He jumped IN the river.
        (2) He threw fruits IN the rIver.
        Thanks.

          Hello Yornis,
          Yes, you can use 'in' here in both sentences.
          In describes location and can also describe movement. Into is only used for movement. In most cases where you can use into you can also use in, but the reverse is not always true. Sometimes into is better as in can be ambiguous. For example:
            He walked into the room. [he was outside and he is now inside]
            He walked in the room. [he was outside and he is now inside or he is walking around within the room]
          Of course, the context usually makes the meaning clear.
          You can read a little more on the topic here:

          Hello Rona Niki,
          'In the summer' is the correct form. I would never say 'on the summer'.
