        I have a question that might be not so related to this topic.
        We say:
        - She found guilty of stealing the money.
        - The man pleaded guilty to manslaughter. (I take the reference from chambers dictionary with some word modification).
        Why sometimes we use "of" and sometimes we use "to"? Can I replace the "to" with "of?"

          Hello PN,
          The key is the verbs used with the word 'guilty'. The forms are as follows:
          be found guilty of a crime
          plead guilty to a crime
          Note 'found' is part of a passive phrase, so it should be 'She was found...' in your first example.
