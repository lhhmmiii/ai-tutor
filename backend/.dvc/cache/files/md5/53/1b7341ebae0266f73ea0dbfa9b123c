  ## Grammar explanation
  We use the passive voice to change the focus of the sentence.
    My bike was stolen. (passive ‚Äì focus on my bike)
Someone stole my bike. (active ‚Äì focus on someone)
  We often use the passive:
  - when we prefer not to mention who or what does the action (for example, it's not known, it's obvious or we don't want to say)
  - so that we can start a sentence with the most important or most logical information
  - in more formal or scientific writing.
  ### How we make the passive
  We make the passive using the verb be + past participle. We start the sentence with the object.

          be
        past participle
  It is not always necessary to add who or what did the action.

          be
        past participle
  Only the form of be changes to make the tense. The past participle stays the same. Here are examples of the passive in its most common tenses.

          Hello KatherineThu,
          Yes, that form exists. It's a modal verb followed by a passive continuous infinitive. For exmaple:
            I put the bread into the oven an hour ago. In 30 minutes it will have been being cooked for an hour and a half. Do you think that will be enough?
          It's an unusual form and quite a long construction so we often avoid it by, for example, turning the verb into active voice. But it is a correct form.

          Hello jassa,
          I want to see it. [active infinitive with 'to']
          I want to be seen. [passive infinitive with 'to']
          Infinitives can have aspect (perfect and continuous) and voice (active or passive).
          You can read more about some of these forms here:

            Thank you very much dear teacher üôè
            One another question-
            Non finite verbs don't show tense, person and number and verbals(infinitives, gerund and participles) are non finite verbs so verbals(infinitives,gerunds and participles)also don't show tense, person and number?
            Thanks.

              Hello again jassa,
              Yes, that's correct. Infinitives, participles and the -ing form are not marked for tense, number or person.

                Ok, many thanks my teacher üôèüëç
                It will be more helpful if you describe what is aspect and what is voice (active and passive) and why we use passive or active voice?
                And only 'to-infinitives' have all four aspects, right?
                Infinitives(without 'to')don't have four aspects?
                Please make this clear dear teacher?

                  Hello again jassa,
                  You can easily look up definitions of aspect and voice online - wikipedia is a good starting point:
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(grammar)
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect
                  Infinitives with or without 'to' can be marked for aspect and voice:
                  You should do it / It should be done
                  You should be doing it / It should be being done [continuous]
                  You should have done it / It should have been done [perfect]
                  You should have been doing it / It should have been being done [perfect continuous]
