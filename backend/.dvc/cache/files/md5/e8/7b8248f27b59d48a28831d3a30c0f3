  ## Grammar explanation
  Adjectives that end in -ed (e.g. bored, interested) and adjectives that end in -ing (e.g. boring, interesting) are often confused.
  ### -ed adjectives
  Adjectives that end in -ed generally describe emotions – they tell us how people feel.
    I was so bored in that lesson, I almost fell asleep.
He was surprised to see Helen after all those years.
She was really tired and went to bed early.
  ### -ing adjectives

    Have you seen that film? It's really frightening.

        I have some tips to distinguish -ed and -ing adjectives easily:
        -ed adjective: Ex: I am really confused about my choice.
        -ing adjective: Ex: The lesson is so boring, I almost fell asleep.
        Can you check my mistakes in sentences? Thank you.
