  ## Grammar explanation
  To make questions, we often put the verb before the subject. This is called inversion.
        Affirmative
        Question
            I am
            Am I
            I can
            Can I
            She is
            Is she
            We have
            Have we
  If there is a question word (why, what, where, how, etc.), it goes before the verb.
        Question
        Question with question word
          Are you late?
            Why
          Was she there?
            When
          Can I help?
            How
          Have we met before?
            Where
  This is true for sentences with be, sentences that have auxiliary verbs (e.g. They are waiting. She has finished.) and sentences with modal verbs (can, will, should, might, etc.).
  ### Questions in the present simple and past simple
  For other verbs in the present simple, we use the auxiliary verb do/does in the question.
        Affirmative
        Question
        Question with question word
          You work at home.
            Do
            work
            do
            work
          It costs £10.
            Does
            cost
            does
            cost
  We use the auxiliary verb did in the past simple.
        Affirmative
        Question
        Question with question word
          She went home.
            Did
            go
            did
            go
          They went to the cinema.
            Did
            go
            did
            go
  ### Subject questions
  In some questions, who or what is the subject of the verb. There is no inversion of subject and verb in these questions.
    Who broke the window?
Who is knocking on the door?

        Please help me with the meaning of one single word in a sentence. I am not certain how to understand the word "generous" in the following sentence:
        "John's will and testament, which has survived, is a generous document."
        Does generous here means "charitable" and "giving" or does it mean "large" and "copious"?
        How do you, as a native speaker, understand this?
        Thank you for any help.

          Hello EliasM,
          To be honest I'm not sure as both meanings could apply here. Perhaps seeing the sentence in a broader context would offer more clues as to the author's intention but by itself I would say that the sentence is ambiguous - possibly deliberately so.

        Hi,
        You haven't talked about the verb "Have" in this lesson or it falls into the category "Questions in the present simple and past simple". If I have an affirmative sentence "You have a bike", how do we do the question and Question with question word in the present simple and in the past simple?
        Thank you in advance.

          Hi Ama1,
          That's right, it falls in the same category so the questions are:
          - Do you/I/we/they have a bike? Does he/she have a bike? (present simple: do/does + subject + have + object)
          - Did you/I/we/they have a bike? Did he/she have a bike? (past simple: did + subject + have + object)

        Hello, there。
The first grammar test, no.5 sees got wrong。
because the "children" were plural, it should be like "they"。
so, the auxiliary should use the "Do" instead of "Does".
please, check it out is there got something wrong。

          Hi kyazall,
          I'll try to help. That's right, "children" is plural and the same as "they". In a present tense sentence, the auxiliary is "do": Do the children go to the park?
          However, in question 5, the person says "went" in the next sentence. So, they are talking about the past, not the present. The past form of "do" is "did": Did the children go to the park?
          Does that make sense?

            Thanks, Jonathan R.
            That makes sense, but it seems the question has changed. because I saw the answer was "does" last time.
            But anyway, thanks for your reply. Thanks for fixing the question. Good luck.

        The subject question for "She broke the window" is Who broke the window?
        However, we say "Why did she break the window?" or "How did she break the window?"
        Can you explain why the tense of the verb changes here.
        Thank you.

          Hello Waldorf Wonderland,
          There is no tense change here. Broke is the past simple form of 'break' and 'did [she] break' is the past simple question form of the same verb.
