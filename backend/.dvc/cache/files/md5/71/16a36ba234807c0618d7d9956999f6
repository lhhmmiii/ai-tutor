  ## Grammar explanation
  A reported question is when we tell someone what another person asked. To do this, we can use direct speech or indirect speech.
    direct speech: 'Do you like working in sales?' he asked.
indirect speech: He asked me if I liked working in sales.
  In indirect speech, we change the question structure (e.g. Do you like) to a statement structure (e.g. I like).
  We also often make changes to the tenses and other words in the same way as for reported statements (e.g. have done → had done, today → that day). You can learn about these changes on the Reported speech 1 – statements page.
  ### Yes/no questions
  In yes/no questions, we use if or whether to report the question. If is more common.
    'Are you going to the Helsinki conference?'
    - He asked me if I was going to the Helsinki conference.
    'Have you finished the project yet?'
    - She asked us whether we'd finished the project yet.
  ### Questions with a question word
  In what, where, why, who, when or how questions, we use the question word to report the question.
    'What time does the train leave?'
    - He asked me what time the train left.
    'Where did he go?'
    - She asked where he went.
  ### Reporting verbs
  The most common reporting verb for questions is ask, but we can also use verbs like enquire, want to know or wonder.
    'Did you bring your passports?'
    - She wanted to know if they'd brought their passports.
    'When could you get this done by?'
    - He wondered when we could get it done by.
  ### Offers, requests and suggestions
  If the question is making an offer, request or suggestion, we can use a specific verb pattern instead, for example offer + infinitive, ask + infinitive or suggest + ing.
    'Would you like me to help you?'
    - He offered to help me.
    'Can you hold this for me, please?'
    - She asked me to hold it.
    'Why don't we check with Joel?'
    - She suggested checking with Joel.

        “Can you show me where the post office is?” she asked
Can I change into “She asked me if I could show her where the post office was.” Or “She asked me to show her where the post office was.”
        How can distinguish between the request and question form, teacher?
        Thanks.

          Hello KatherineThu,
          Both forms are correct and both accurately report the original question.
          I'm not sure what you rmean by distinguish between them, however. They are alternative forms with the same meaning: relating a request. The request is in the form of a question, hence the two different forms, but the meaning is the same in each.

        Hello, I was wondering if a sentence contains words like Yes, or No, how would we change the narration. For example:
        The man said, "No, I refuse to surrender my rights".
        Can it be changed as
        The man refused to surrender his rights.
        Or
        The man said that he refused to surrender his rights.
        Or
        The man informed in negation and said that he refused to surrender his rights.
        Or guide if there is any other way  to change its narration.
        Also, of a sentence contains yes, e.g.
        He said, "Yes, I admit my mistake"
        What word would substitute yes here.
        Thank you so much for providing this platform!!

          Hello Ayesha27,
          There are often multiple ways of reporting speech - English is quite flexible in this regard.
            The man said, "No, I refuse to surrender my rights".
            Can it be changed as
            The man refused to surrender his rights.
          Yes, that's fine.
            The man said that he refused to surrender his rights.
          That's also fine.
            The man informed in negation and said that he refused to surrender his rights.
          This is is not possible. 'Informed in negation' is not a phrase we use.
            Also, of a sentence contains yes, e.g.
            He said, "Yes, I admit my mistake"
            What word would substitute yes here.
          You can use a verb like 'agreed that' or 'accepted that' to show that the man is responding to a question or statement. You could also use something like 'it is/was true that':
          The man said that it was true that he had made a mistake.

        Hello!
        I was wondering if it is okay to use both options in the following sentence:
        - David asked me politely to give him a hand.
        - David asked me if I could give him a hand.
        I hope I am not burdening you with it,
        Thank you for your reply in advance
        Best regards!

          Hello Anastasiaaaa,
          Yes, both of those are correct. Well done!
          A lot of reporting verbs, like 'ask' have patterns like this. You can read more about it here:

          Hi par_iss89,
          The third sentence is grammatically correct; the others all contain errors in word order.
          Please note that generally we do not answer questions like this as we are not a service for providing answers to tasks from elsewhere. We would end up doing people's tests and homework for them if so! Our main role is providing explanations as to why something is correct or not rather than answers to tasks.

        Hello! :)
        I have a question concerning reported questions. I have trouble understanding how to change the auxiliary verb "do" in questions.
        For example:
        - Direct Speech: "Did you give Aunt Sadia my flight details?"
        - Indirect Speech: He asked his parents if they had given Aunt Sadia his flight details.
        In this case, the "did give" in the direct speech makes the backshift from simple past to past perfect (had given). In my grammar book at school, it says that we should omit do/did/does when reporting questions. I thought the indirect speech of the sentence was "He asked his parents if they gave Aunt Sadia his flight details" because I omitted the "did" as it was explained in my book to do so. Now there's another question:
        - Direct Speech: "Do I need a large suitcase for the trip?"
        - Indirect Speech: He asked his parents if he needed a large suitcase for the trip.
        I don't quite understand why I can omit the "do" in the indirect speech in this case and only make the backshift of the tense for "need" (--> "needed"). Why can't I say "He asked his parents if he did need a large suitcase?".

          Hello AGermanGirlLearningEnglish,
          I think your question is not really about omitting 'did'. Let me explain.
          When we report questions we do not use the question structure. For example:
            Where is he?
            > She asked where he is.
          Here, the original sentence is a question and uses inversion: the verb (is) comes before the subject (he). In the reported question we simply use the structure for a regular sentence: the verb (is) comes after the subject (he). Notice that backshifting is not necessary when the situation is still the same. In other words, if she is still wondering where he is then we can leave the sentence in the present. Another example of reported speech should make this clear:
            "I love you."
            She said she loved me. [she loved me when she said it; we don't know if she still loves me now]
            She said she loves me. [she loved me when she said it and she still loves me now]
          When we report a question we use the same question word (where, when, who etc) as in the original/direct speech sentence. When the question is a yes/no question we use 'if'. So, in your example we use 'if' and then regular sentence structure
            Did you give Aunt Sadia my flight details?
            He asked his parents if they had given Aunt Sadia his flight details.
          You can use 'gave' here instead of 'had given' if the situation is still unchanged. Since (from the context) it seems clear that this is the case, 'gave' should be fine here.
          Your second example works the same way:
            Do I need a large suitcase for the trip?
            He asked his parents if he needed a large suitcase for the trip.
          'Did' is not needed as we use a regular sentence structure. You could use a present form ('needs') if the trip has not happened yet, but backshifting is fine here in either case.
