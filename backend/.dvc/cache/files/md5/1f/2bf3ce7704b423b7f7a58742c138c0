          Hello David998,
          If we want to ask about the clock time then we say this:
            What time is it?
            It's four o'clock.
          If we want to ask about a length of time then we say this:
            How long do we have? or How much time do we have?
            We have two hours (before we must go).
          If we want to ask about duration (of a film, for example) then we say this:
            How long does the film last? or How long is the film?
            It lasts two hours or It's two hours long.

        Hello.
        Which sentence is correct? I'm interested in books or I'm interested in reading books.
        Thanks in advance.

          Hello Monike.sophie10,
          Both sentences are correct.
          In is a preposition and must have an object. The object can be a noun (like 'books') or an -ing form/gerund (like 'reading'), so both sentences are grammatically correct. The difference is that the first sentence is less specific. The speaker may be interested in books because they enjoy reading them, but could also be a collector of books or someone who enjoys studying the history of books.

          Hello LukaX2001,
          Creating pdf worksheets is a very time-intensive process for us. Sometimes we publish a page without the pdf worksheets and try to add them when time allows.

        Hi,
I know we can contract this - "teacher is" to "teacher's"
(But my Grammarly spell checker suggest it is wrong)
My question is can we contract - "teachers are"
If the answer is Yes, how? And if the answer is No, why?
Thanks in advance.

          Hi RajithaSL,
          Grammarly and similar apps are only ever rough guides. They can be useful but they are fairly blunt instruments, especially when it comes to grammar suggestions, as they do not take much context into account.
          Contractions can lead to ambiguity. For example, teacher's could be teacher is or it could be a possessive form. Apps like Grammarly have problems identifying which one you intend and often correct to the unambiguous option, sacrificing variety and style in the process. Whether or not teacher's is a good choice for your text would depend on the broader context, so I can't say whether it would be a good choice in your case.
          Generally we contract other forms of 'be' only with pronouns (I, you, he etc). Sometimes 'will' is contracted in informal writing, but it is unusual. Thus, you can contract 'are' with you, we and they, but not with full nouns.
