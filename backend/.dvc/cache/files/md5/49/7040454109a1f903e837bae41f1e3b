  ## Grammar explanation
  In informal conversation, we commonly leave out words. This is called ellipsis. We can use ellipsis when the meaning is obvious without the missing items.
  We can use ellipsis in the following situations.
  ### After linkers
  We don't have to repeat the subject after the linkers and, but and or.
    We had a late dinner and [we] went to bed.
    Once the kids have left for school, I read a book or [I] do some baking.
  If the repeated subject is with the verb be, we can omit both the subject and be.
    Clare is working a lot at the moment and [she's] getting up really early.
    She's growing up and [she's] starting to want more alone time.
  Note that ellipsis doesn't work after other linkers, such as before, after, because, when and while.
    We watch TV after we have dinner.
We watch TV after have dinner.
  ### After to
  We can often avoid repeating part of a verb phrase after to.
    A: Have you tried that new restaurant yet?
B: No, I wanted to [try that new restaurant], but it's on the other side of town.
    Some people give up sugar completely, but I didn't want to [give up sugar completely].
  ### After auxiliaries and modals
  We can also avoid repeating part of a verb phrase after auxiliaries and modals.
    I hadn't noticed it, but my son had [noticed it].
    She said she'd get back to me by the end of the week and she has [got back to me by the end of the week].
    They were getting ice creams because I said they could [get ice creams].
  ### Omitting subject pronouns
  Sometimes we can miss out the pronoun, because it's obvious who or what we're talking about.
    [It/That] Sounds familiar!
    [It] Wouldn't have occurred to me.
  ### Omitting subjects and auxiliary verbs
  Sometimes we can miss out both the pronoun and the auxiliary verb that goes with it. This is most common in informal questions and particularly with the verbs want and have got.
    [Do you] Want some coffee?
    [Have you] Got a lot of homework?
  ### Omitting auxiliary verbs
  In other informal questions, we can leave out the auxiliary verbs be, have and do.
    [Are] You going to Gina's party?
    [Have] You got a minute to talk?
    [Does] She eat out every day?
    [Will] You give me a ring?
  Note that this doesn't work with I or it.
    Have I given you an idea?
I given you an idea?

          Hello Nour Shekho,
          Yes, these constructions are all grammatically correct and represent natural language use. However, I would say that the examples marked as more informal would not be appropriate in terms of style for the written part of the exam, so I would avoid these in that part. During the speaking part, however, as long as you use them correctly they are absolutely fine.

          Hello rsgcc310,
          Yes, that sentence is grammatically correct. It describes what you usually do: a habit or a routine.

        May I know if the second verb 'will'(will realize) can be omitted in this sentence ?
        "I hope that people will spend more time on this and that they will realize the importance of it."

          Hello Carolcar,
          No, you can't omit 'realize' here. We omit some elements of a sentence when they are repeated or obvious from the sentence structure, so here you could omit 'that' (repeated), 'they' (referring to 'people'), and 'will' (repeated). This gives you this sentence:
            I hope that people will spend more time on this and realize the importance of it.

          Hi tugbanurtezvergil,
          Yes, sure! Ellipsis is one of the ways that a writer can connect their ideas and make their writing coherent.
          However, in formal writing, people don't usually omit subjects and/or auxiliary verbs. They do use other forms of ellipsis, though.
          I hope that helps.
