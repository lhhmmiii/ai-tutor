  ## Grammar explanation
  ### Gradable adjectives
  Most adjectives are gradable. This means we can have different levels of that quality. For example, you can be a bit cold, very cold or extremely cold. We can make them weaker or stronger with modifiers:
    She was quite angry when she found out.
The film we saw last night was really funny!
It can be extremely cold in Russia in the winter.
  Here is a list of some common gradable adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.
          Modifiers
          a little/a bit
          pretty/quite
          really/very
          extremely
          Adjectives
          angry
          big
          boring
          cheap, cold
          expensive
          frightening, funny
          hot
          interesting
          old
          pretty
          small
          tasty
          tired
  ### Non-gradable: absolute adjectives
  Some adjectives are non-gradable. For example, something can't be a bit finished or very finished. You can't be a bit dead or very dead. These adjectives describe absolute qualities. To make them stronger we have to use modifiers like absolutely, totally or completely:
    Thank you, I love it! It's absolutely perfect!
Their farm was totally destroyed by a tornado.
My work is completely finished. Now I can relax.
  Here is a list of some common absolute adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.
          Modifiers
          absolutely/totally/completely
          Adjectives
          acceptable
          dead
          destroyed
          finished
          free
          impossible
          necessary
          perfect
          ruined
          unacceptable
  ### Non-gradable: extreme adjectives
  Adjectives like amazing, awful and boiling are also non-gradable. They already contain the idea of 'very' in their definitions. If we want to make extreme adjectives stronger, we have to use absolutely or really:
    Did you see the final match? It was absolutely amazing!
After 32 hours of travelling, they were absolutely exhausted.
My trip home was really awful. First, traffic was really bad, then the car broke down and we had to walk home in the rain.
  Here is a list of some common extreme adjectives and some modifiers that we can use with them.
          Modifiers
          absolutely/really
          Adjectives
          amazing, ancient
          awful
          boiling
          delicious
          enormous, excellent
          exhausted
          fascinating
          freezing
          gorgeous
          terrible
          terrifying
          tiny

        From what I've learnt today, helpful is is a gradable adjective so I rate this lesson to be EXTREMELY HELPFUL.

        Hi all! 
Can anyone explain why "In real life, it was VERY tiny"  is wrong? 
Grammar test 2 - last question

Above when it explains the gradable adjectives and it shows very/really is interchangable.
