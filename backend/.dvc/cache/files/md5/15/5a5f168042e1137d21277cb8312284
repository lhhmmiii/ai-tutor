  ## Grammar explanation
  We use wish and if only to talk about things that we would like to be different in either the present or the past. If only is usually a bit stronger than wish.
  ### In the present
  We can use wish/if only + a past form to talk about a present situation we would like to be different.
    I wish you didn't live so far away.
If only we knew what to do.
He wishes he could afford a holiday.
  ### In the past
  We can use wish/if only + a past perfect form to talk about something we would like to change about the past.
    They wish they hadn't eaten so much chocolate. They're feeling very sick now.
If only I'd studied harder when I was at school.
  ### Expressing annoyance
  We can use wish + would(n't) to show that we are annoyed with what someone or something does or doesn't do. We often feel that they are unlikely or unwilling to change.
    I wish you wouldn't borrow my clothes without asking.
I wish it would rain. The garden really needs some water.
She wishes he'd work less. They never spend any time together.

        Hello sir, is it also correct to use 'wouldn't have to' in the sentence "I wish I didn't have to go to work tomorrow." ?

          Hello HungKK,
          No, that is not correct. Would in this context describes a choice not an obligation.
          When the sentence is about a person's choice or behaviour you can use 'would' when you are talking about someone else but not yourself. For example:
            I wish he wouldn't do that. - correct
            I wish I wouldn't do that. - incorrect
          This is because if it is your choice you can simply not do it; there is no reason to wish for a change in behaviour if you are controlling the behaviour.

        Hello Sir,
        Can I answer test 1 question like this?
        It looks like rain. I wish I could bring my umbrella.
        In test 2, I don't know why this is incorrect.
        If only I took the time off work, I'd come and visit you.
        Could you explain the sentence?

          Hello Aung Qui,
          Re: test 1, yes, that is a possible correct answer. It would appropriate when you hadn't left home already. But if you were already out, then the correct answer in the exercise would be correct and 'could bring' would not.
          Re: test 2, the idea is that the speaker isn't able to take time off work. They have the desire to take time off, but they are not able to, perhaps because they have already used all their available leave. 'could take' best expresses this idea. 'took' would be speaking about the present or future, but it would be odd to regret something that you can still change.
          Does that make sense?
          Best wishes,
Kirk

        it looks  the good answer is not correct:
          If only he were here now. He'd know what to do.
          for me it would be: If only he was here now. He'd know what to do.

          Hello jlbaby,
          Both 'was' and 'were' are correct here. We can use 'were' for all persons (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) in a clause referring to an unreal time.
          Best wishes,

        Dear Kirk, Peter or Jonathan
        I have a doubt and I hope you can help me:
        The followed sentences are both correct, aren’t they?
        1 If only I knew what doing
        2 If only I had known what doing
        In the first one, we talk about a present situation, right?
        Instead, in the last one, we talk about a state concluded in the past.
        The use of if only/wish + Past Perfect shows us like a sensation of regret, because we would have done something different in the past. Is it true?
        My last doubt: I don’t understand if we have to use wish+would/wouldn’t only to talk about present situations.
        Thanks for your marvellous work.

          Hello Libra23,
          No, those sentences are not correct. First of all, after 'If only...' we shift the tense back so a past form describes the present and a past perfect form describes the past:
            If only I knew... [present situation]
            If only I had known... [past situation]
          Next, after 'what' you need a clause, not just an -ing form:
            If only I had known what I was doing.
          Wish + would describes something we don't like about the present. It is used when there is a choice involved:
            I wish he wouldn't talk so loudly on the phone. [he talks loudly and I don't like it]
          We don't use 'wish' to talk about the future. Instead, we use 'hope' or 'believe':
            I hope he stops talking so loudly on the phone.

            Hello Peter,
            The difference between wish/if only + past tense and wish + would/wouldn’t is that in the last one there’s “a choice involved”, isn’t it? So, if I say:
            I wish he would eat more healthy ——> I think he can change his life style
            I wish he ate more healthy ——> I don’t think there’s any choice
            Could you add more examples about hope/believe to talk about the future?
