    Have you tried turning the computer off and on again?
  Try + to + infinitive means that something is difficult but you are making an effort to do it.

        Hi,
        When I want to say that I want sb to do sth else using 'would rather' Should I say, for example, I would rather you stayed than went or I would rather you stayed than go?
        Best wishes

          Hello Zuzanna123,
          The verbs should be consistent so you should use 'went':
            I would rather you stayed than went.

        Hi,
        Which one is correct?
        I tried to lift the suitcase but it was too heavy.
        Vs
        I tried lifting the suitcase but it was too heavy
        I noticed that in your " try to..." example, you ended that sentence with "but" followed by a reason FOR the failure identical to  the one in the my sentence. Is it a convention that "try to..." BE followed by "but"?
        Also, tell me whether "reason" should be followed by "of" or "for", in this question paragraph ("for "has been capitalised for your perusal).
        Finally, is the subjunctive "be" that I have used in this question employed in accordance with the rules of Grammar? Once again, the "be" in question is capitalised for your convenience .

          Hello GnaisAugustus,
          Both could possibly be correct (since 'tried to lift' refers more to difficulty and 'tried lifting' refers more to an experiment), but since 'but it was too heavy' implies that the speaker could not lift the suitcase, I'd say 'tried to lift' is the best answer.
          Often there is a phrase with 'but' with both 'try to Verb' and 'try Verbing', so you have to consider what the most likely meaning is when deciding which form to use. The context should make this clear in many contexts. And yes, 'reason for the failure' is correct (not 'reason of').
          And yes, it's fine to say 'be' in the way that you did. It's a little unusual in informal conversation -- where we'd probably say 'Is it correct to use 'but' after 'try to?' -- but it is correct.
          Best wishes,
Kirk

          Hello MartialWhite,
          There are two possible ways to correct the sentence:
            Increasing overpopulation is the biggest threat human beings face today
            Increasing overpopulation is the biggest threat facing human beings today
          Please note that generally we do not correct sentences for users. Our focus is on explaining, not correcting. Otherwise we would end up just being a proofreading service!

            Thank you Peter.
Could you please explain why "facing" can't be used in 1st sentence?

              Hello again MartialWhite,
              The first sentence is actually a relative clause where the relative pronoun has been omitted:
                Increasing overpopulation is the biggest threat that/which human beings face today.
              In a relative clause you need a finite verb (face) after the subject (human beings), not a participle.

            Hello, hope all of you are fine.
I have read a sentence recently which I doubt is wrong. I need help in understanding that sentence. The sentence is:
"Problems facing parents should be discussed. "
I think this sentence should be like
*Problems faced by parents should be discussed.*
Your expert opinion is required please.
