  ## Grammar explanation
  We can use so and such to intensify adjectives, adverbs and nouns.
  ### Adjectives and adverbs
  We can use so with an adjective or adverb to make it stronger.
    It's so hot today!
She looks so young in that photo.
He walks so slowly. It's so annoying!
  If we are using the comparative form of the adjective or adverb, we use so much to make it stronger.
    They were so much more innocent when they were younger.
I work so much more quickly when I can concentrate.
  ### Nouns
  With a noun or adjective + noun, we use such to make it stronger.
    You're such an angel!
It's such a hot day today!
They're such lovely trousers. Where did you buy them?
  However, when we use much, many, little and few with a noun, we use so to make it stronger.
    There are so many people here!
I've had so little time to myself this week.
  ### Saying the result
  We often use these so and such structures with that and a clause to say what the result is.
    It was so cold that the water in the lake froze.
He was such a good teacher that we all passed the exam.
There's so much noise that I can't think!

        Hi and thanks for the useful information.
I have a question about so+ much/many + noun+ that structure.
        Can we only use a noun in this structure?
She has som much money that she can buy whatever she wants.
        Or it is also possible to use adjective+ noun:
        There are so many beautiful places that we can have a lot of fun exploring them.
        Thank you in advance for your answer.

          Hi Liiibra,
          Using an adjective here is fine and both sentences are grammatically correct. Good job!

        Art and Music plays an important role in kidsâ€™ development. Therefore, it is highly encouraged that parents send their kids to such clubs. Can I use the word such in the sentence above?

        Hello dears. Your input in answering the questions is greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for your valuable contribution.th
This is a multi-option question: "Due to Ibn Sina, much of the classical learning of Greece were preserved during the European Dark Ages when such knowledge would otherwise have been lost." and 4 phrases are underlined as one of them is incorrect and should be corrected: a) the classical learning, b) were preserved, c) such knowledge, d) have been lost.
what do you think about the right answer? considering both "learning" and "knowledge" are uncountable nouns.

          Hi sinameghdad,
          We're glad you find our site useful!
          I would choose b) as the incorrect one. The noun phrase "much of the classical learning of Greece" needs a singular verb form ("was preserved") rather than a plural one. I hope that helps.

            Hi Dear Jonathan
Nice to receive your help. That's great! Thanks a lot
Yes actually b as an incorrect verb for learning is the right answer. but what about d: have been lost? it refers to "such knowledge" and considering "knowledge" an uncountable word should not it be "has been lost". unless accepting that "such" makes it countable and therefore its verb accordingly is in plural form. does "such" has such a function?
Thank you again and hope you the best

              Hello singmeghdad,
              The verb in that phrase isn't 'have been lost' -- instead it is 'would have been lost'. After modal verbs we always use 'have' and never 'has'.
              Best wishes,
Kirk

        Hello
In the example above: It's so hot today! , the role: we use 'such' with adjective + noun
why you didn't use 'such' instead of 'so'?
thank you!
