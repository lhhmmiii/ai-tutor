        I am learning English in the study room; suddenly, a cat jumped onto my table, which made my thermos cup spill.

        Hello teachers,
        I would be grateful if you could help me with the below.
        (1) There are two libraries IN my school.
        (2) There is a food court IN this mall.
        I am quite sure we can use "in" for the above two.
        But is "at" an equally suitable preposition for no. (1) and (2) above?
        (3) I used "is" just after "But" in the sentence just before this.
        I know that the word "would" would be a right word to use there; I am just curious as to whether my using "is" there is also correct in that context ( in standard English ) . Thank you.

          Hello Yornis,

          Yes, both prepositions are possible though I think 'in' is better in each case as it more precisely describes the location (inside the building). 'At' tends to have a more general meaning of 'close to' or 'in the same area as'.
            (3) I used "is" just after "But" in the sentence just before this.
            I know that the word "would" would be a right word to use there; I am just curious as to whether my using "is" there is also correct in that context ( in standard English ) . Thank you.
          Yes, both forms are possible here.

          Hello Yornis,
          - Both prepositions are fine here and I don't think there is much of a difference. Perhaps 'at' would be more common if the speaker were not a teacher - a cleaner, administrator, technician etc.
          - Here, 'at' is better. To my ear 'in' suggests that the football field is inside the school building, which is unlikely.

        Hi.
        I'm a litlle confused.
        In the lesson explain:
        "We also use in with other physical locations such as:
          in the world
in water / the sea / a river / a lake / a pool."
          But when I answer the grammar test 2:
          "5. Last summer we stayed in a cabin _____ a lake. "
          I choose IN but the correct is ON.
          Could you please help with this.
          Thanks so much,
        Adriana

          Hello Adriana,
          When we talk about physical locations, in the lake means getting wet while by the lake or on the lake means next to it. Since the cabin is probably not under the water you need on the lake here.
          You can swim in the lake but you stay in a cabin/hotel etc on the lake or by the lake.
