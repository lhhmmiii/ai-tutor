  ## Grammar explanation
  Conditionals describe the result of a certain condition. The if clause tells you the condition (If you study hard) and the main clause tells you the result (you will pass your exams). The order of the clauses does not change the meaning.
    If you study hard, you will pass your exams.
You will pass your exams if you study hard.
  Conditional sentences are often divided into different types.
  ### Zero conditional
  We use the zero conditional to talk about things that are generally true, especially for laws and rules.
    If I drink too much coffee, I can't sleep at night.
Ice melts if you heat it.
When the sun goes down, it gets dark.
  The structure is: if/when + present simple >> present simple.
  ### First conditional
  We use the first conditional when we talk about future situations we believe are real or possible.
    If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the beach.
Arsenal will be top of the league if they win.
When I finish work, I'll call you.
  In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually: if/when + present simple >> will + infinitive.
  It is also common to use this structure with unless, as long as, as soon as or in case instead of if.
    I'll leave as soon as the babysitter arrives.
I don't want to stay in London unless I get a well-paid job.
I'll give you a key in case I'm not at home.
You can go to the party, as long as you're back by midnight.
  ### Second conditional
  The second conditional is used to imagine present or future situations that are impossible or unlikely in reality.
    If we had a garden, we could have a cat.
If I won a lot of money, I'd buy a big house in the country.
I wouldn't worry if I were you.
  The structure is usually: if + past simple >> + would + infinitive.
  When if is followed by the verb be, it is grammatically correct to say if I were, if he were, if she were and if it were. However, it is also common to hear these structures with was, especially in the he/she form.
    If I were you, I wouldn't mention it.
If she was prime minister, she would invest more money in schools.
He would travel more if he was younger.

        Hello,
        As for the second conditional and the structure used to talk about hypothetical situations:
        if + past simple >> + would + infinitive.
        In some stories, I have found a similar construction:
        Instead of "If I won the lottery, I would travel around the world", this sentence "If I were to win the lottery, I would travel around the world."
        This makes me confused. Could you please explain it?
        Thank you

          Hello User_1,
          Certain types of if-clauses in conditional structure can be inverted in this way to create a more formal version. Three are most common:
            1. if + past for unreal present/future
            If I won the lottery, ...
            If I were to win the lottery, ...
            2. if + past perfect for unreal past
            If I had gone to university, ...
            Had I gone to university, ...
            3. if + should for unexpected or unplanned present/future
            If I should die, ...
            Should I die, ...

        Which sentence is correct?
        If children play with fire, they will get burned.
        Or
        If children play with fire, they get burned.
        Thanks in advance.

          Hello aknm2008,
          Both sentences are correct.
          The second sentence describes a general truth about children and fire - something that is always truea. The first sentence describes what the speaker believes to be the likely result of a given action. In this context these two meanings are essentially the same.

        Hello there.
        A rather simple, basic question, most likely with an obvious answer, judging from the explanation: if I use ⟨will⟩ on a conditional sentence building, is it automatically and unequivocally not an instance of "zero conditional"?
        Thanks beforehand. Have a nice day.

          Hello N.A.K.F.
          The names 'zero conditional', 'first conditional' and so on are not true grammatical categories. Rather, they are labels we attach to common conditional structures as an aid for teaching and learning. In other words, they do not represent rules but rather common patterns which can be memorised.
          In reality, there are only two rules regarding conditional structures:
          - The sentence must be consistent in terms of the two clauses (the if-clause and the result clause) being either real/likely or unreal/unlikely. You cannot mix real with unreal.
          - The condition must occur earlier in time than the result clause - in other words, no time-travelling!
          So long as these two rules are followed you can create all sorts of conditional forms. You can have real present/general time in both clauses:
          If children are late for school, their teachers are angry.
          You can have real past general time in both clauses:
          If I was late for school as a child, the teacher was angry.
          You can have a real present time condition and a future result:
          If you are late for school, your teacher will be angry.
          You can have a real past condition with a future result:
          If you were late for school yesterday, the headmistress will be angry when she sees you tomorrow.
          And, of course, many other combinations are possible.
          What I'm showing you is that you should not treat the labels we use as rules but rather patterns which provide a few useful constructions. They offer a starting point, not a set of rules to be followed.

          Hello ShetuYogme,
          For real/likely/plausible present conditions with future results we use if + present for the condition and a future form for the result. The future form can be a modal verb such as will or might, or it can be another form with future meaning like going to. The information regarding 'first conditonal' is relevant here.

            Hello again Peter,
            The same structure is used for conditional sentences with future condition and future results.
              If it rains, I will not go to play cricket tomorrow.
            The condition is in the future and so is the result.
            How do I know whether the condition is in the present or the future?
            Thank you.
