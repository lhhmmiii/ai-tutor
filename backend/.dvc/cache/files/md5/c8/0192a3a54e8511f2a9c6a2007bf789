  ## Grammar explanation
  We can use modal verbs for deduction ‚Äì guessing if something is true using the available information. The modal verb we choose shows how certain we are about the possibility. This page focuses on making deductions about the present or future.
  ### must
  We use must when we feel sure that something is true or it's the only realistic possibility.
    This must be her house. I can see her car in the garage.
He must live near here because he always walks to work.
Come inside and get warm. You must be freezing out there!
  ### might, may, could
  We use might, may or could to say that we think something is possible but we're not sure.
    She's not here yet. She might be stuck in traffic.
He's not answering. He could be in class.
We regret to inform you that some services may be delayed due to the bad weather.
  They all have the same meaning, but may is more formal than might and could.
  ### can't
  We use can't when we feel sure that something is not possible.
    It can't be far now. We've been driving for hours.
She can't know about the complaint. She's promoted him to team leader.
It can't be easy for him, looking after three kids on his own.
  Note that these verbs, like all modal verbs, are followed by an infinitive without to.

        Hello dear teachersüëã
The sentences written below have the same meaning?Can we use these sentences interchangeably?

Or I think John is angry with you. 
2.The children might be playing outside. 
Or Maybe/perhaps the children are playing outside.
3.There might be a dog in that house.
Or I am guessing that there is a dog in that house.
        Thanks.

          Hello sartaj,
          When we are speculating, the modal verbs may, could and might are interchangeable, and adverbs like maybe and perhaps have a similar meaning. I think... gives a person's view or belief, so depending on the context it may have a slightly different sense. I am guessing... sounds a little more tentative to me. However, as I said, the context and elements such as tone of voice are key.

            Ok, thank you very much for the answer dear Peter.My another question related to this is-
            Do i write the sentence (below) right? 
"We might have to go now"
'To go' is used in this sentence.Then why it's said that infinitive  with 'to' can't be used with modal verbs?
            Please explain this.

              Hello again sartaj,
              In this sentence might is the modal verb and it is followed by the construction have to + verb.
              Have to is sometimes described as a semi-modal (though this is not a term used in linguistics) as it has a modal meaning (obligation) but is not a modal verb in terms of structure. It forms negatives and questions with the auxiliary do, for example, and has a past tense.

          Hello Himalaya,
          We use the modal verb will for hopes, beliefs and predictions about the present or the future. In your example will describes the speaker's belief about the present. It is different from must and the other modal verbs here as it represents a belief rather than a logical deduction on the basis of evidence or existing knowledge.

          Hello jassa,
          You can use either form and there is no difference in meaning.

            One another questionüôã
            The model verb 'Will' is used in first conditional and mixed conditional sentences but not in zero, second, third and forth conditional sentences?
            Thanksüëç

              Hello jassa,
              'Will' can be used in real conditional sentences to describe a predicted or sure result in the future.
              These names ('first conditional', 'second conditional' etc) are not real grammatical classifications  but rather names we give to particular common patterns as an aid to learning. In reality, all conditionals follow the same simple two rules:
              - The result must be later in time than the condition
              - The whole sentence is either about a real/possible/likely situation or an unreal/impossible/unlikely situation; you cannot mix these.
              As long as these two rules are followed, you can create all sorts of patterns. For example, you can have a real past situation and a real future result:
                If she didn't study at the weekend she will fail her exam tomorrow.
