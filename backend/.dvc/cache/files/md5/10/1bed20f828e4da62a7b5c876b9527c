  ## Grammar explanation
  Do you know how to use third and mixed conditionals?
  ### Third conditionals and mixed conditionals
  Conditionals describe the result of a certain condition. The if clause tells you the condition (If I hadn't been ill) and the main clause tells you the result (I would have gone to the party). The order of the clauses does not change the meaning.
    If I hadn't been ill, I would have gone to the party.
I would have gone to the party if I hadn't been ill.
  Conditional sentences are often divided into different types.
  ### Third conditional
  The third conditional is used to imagine a different past. We imagine a change in a past situation and the different result of that change.
    If I had understood the instructions properly, I would have passed the exam.
We wouldn't have got lost if my phone hadn't run out of battery.
  In third conditional sentences, the structure is usually: If + past perfect >> would have + past participle.
  ### Mixed conditionals
  We can use mixed conditionals when we imagine a past change with a result in the present or a present change with a result in the past.
  #### 1. Past/Present
  Here's a sentence imagining how a change in a past situation would have a result in the present.
    If I hadn't got the job in Tokyo, I wouldn't be with my current partner.
  So the structure is: If + past perfect >> would + infinitive.
  #### 2. Present/Past
  Here's a sentence imagining how a different situation in the present would mean that the past was different as well.
    It's really important. If it wasn't, I wouldn't have called you on your holiday.
  And the structure is: If + past simple >> would have + past participle.

        I wouldn't have found a good job if I hadn't moved to Thailand.
        Is that correct?

        It is a handy and helpful site. If it wasn't, I wouldn't have spend much time studying with it.

          Hello koudous1425,
          The verb forms in your sentence are fine. I'd change only a couple of small things:
          If had known about this British Council site earlier, my English level would be better (than it is (now)).

        Hello.
        "If you could change one thing about this week what would it be?" I saw this sentence and I have a question why do we use conditional 2, if we are talking about past?
        After that I tried to answer this question and I'd stuck. How should I answer it and should I use mixed conditionals? Are those below correct?
        "I've got a 3 for my test. If I had a majic wand and could wave it this week, i would not overreact to the bad news. I would take it easy."  If it's correct, why don't we use conditional 3 here talking about past?
        "This week was exhausting, however if I changed something, I should/would have found time to go out with my classmates more to change the scenery" Here I tried to use mixed conditional, is it okay?
        Which way is better and why?

          Hello artika_11,
          In your first example you are talking about a change which you make now, not a change you made previously. Since it's not real, you can think of it like a magic spell. It changes the past, but you make the change now, not in the past.
          Your second example is similar. You are talking about having a magic wand now. The wand has the ability to change the past, but the change (waving the wand) happens in the present.
            "This week was exhausting, however if I changed something, I should/would have found time to go out with my classmates more to change the scenery"
          I think the sentence needs a few changes:
            This week was exhausting, however if I were to change anything, it would be to go out with my classmates more to change the scenery.
            This week was exhausting, however if I could change anything, it would be to go out with my classmates more to change the scenery.
            This week was exhausting, however if I could change anything, it would be to have gone out with my classmates more to change the scenery.
          The conditional structure is still if + past > would for the reasons explained above.

        Dear sir,
        I am an English learner. Recently, I come across this questions.
        What is the difference between these two sentences?   Are they both grammatically correct?  Thanks for your help.
        - If I were rich, I would travel the world.
        - If I were rich, I would have traveled the world.

          Hello Ribena,
          Both sentences are grammatically possible.
          The if-clause in each sentence describes an imaginary present or general time situation. The speaker is not rich and is imagining being rich.
          The result clause in the first sentence (I would travel) describes a present or future result. The result clause in the second sentence (I would have travelled) describes a past result - something the speaker would have done in their past.
