  ## Grammar explanation
  A few and a bit of or a little mean some. Often we feel this amount is enough or more than we expected. We use a few with plural nouns and a bit of or a little with uncountable nouns.
    I have a few ideas.
I've brought a few friends.
There's a bit of milk left.
It needs a little more work.
  We use few and very little to show that we are talking about a small amount. Often we feel this amount is not enough or less than we expected. Few is for countable nouns and very little is for uncountable nouns.
    Few people came to the meeting.
There are few places where you can still see these birds.

  Note that you can use little without very, but it is less common and sounds quite formal.

          Hello David998,
          It sounds strange but in English money is uncountable, so you can use quantifiers like 'a little', 'some' or 'a lot of' but you can't use 'a few'.

          Hello Long Khanh,
          In terms of grammar, 'a lot of' can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns, while 'a few' can only be used with countable; 'a little' is the equivalent for uncountable nouns.
          In terms of meaning, I think they are very close and any differences would be context dependent. 'A few' usually suggests that the amount is satisfactory or sufficient for some purpose. For example, if I said 'I have a few hours free today' it would imply that I can do something (go for a coffee with you, finish a task etc). 'Some' is a little more neutral, I would suggest. However, as I said, these are context-dependent nuances.

            Thank you for your prompt reply. Is it true that “a few” generally indicates a number or a figure of five or less. On the other hand, “some” indicates a larger quantity that ranges between five and ten?

              Hello again Long Khanh,
              I don't think there is any fixed rule about this. The choice of quantifiers like this is really a question of how the speaker sees the situation rather than a particular number of items. For example, both 'some' and 'a few' could be used in this kind of situation:
                Customer: I need a dozen boxes of paper for photocopying, please.
                Shop owner: A dozen, huh? Well, I've got some some / a few in the storeroom but we'll have to check if we have enough.

              I agree with Peter that there is no specific number range within which these quantifiers may be used, though generally "some" is used for a bigger quantity than "a few". Hope this helps.

          Hi marjikjikjik,
          "A few" and "few" have different meanings. "A few" has a generally positive meaning, and "few" has a generally negative meaning. For example:
          - "I have a few friends" - this means I have enough friends, or I have some friends.
          - "I have few friends" - this means I have not many friends, or not enough friends.
          In the example you mentioned, it should be "a few days" because the meaning is "some days" or "enough days".
          I hope that helps to understand it.
