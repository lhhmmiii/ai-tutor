  ## Grammar explanation
  We use I/you/we/they + have got or he/she/it + has got to talk about things that we have.
  In many situations, have and have got mean the same thing. Have got is a little less formal than have. We often use have got more in speaking and have more in writing.
    They have got a big garden. = They have a big garden.
She has got a good job. = She has a good job.
  We can use have/has got to talk about appearance, family and friends or possessions. We often contract the verb, especially when we're speaking.
    I have got brown hair. = I've got brown hair.
My sister has got long hair. = My sister's got long hair.
He has not got many friends. = He hasn't got many friends.
They have got a new car. = They've got a new car.
  We can also use have/has got for timetabled events, illnesses or abstract things.
    They've got basketball practice this evening.
He's got a terrible cold. 
I've got a good idea!

Has she got a meeting this morning? Yes, she has.
          Yes, I/you/we/they have.
          No, I/you/we/they haven't.
          Yes, he/she/it has.

          Hello sephannielorent,
          When 'has' or 'have' are used as auxiliary verbs they can be contracted:
          He has got a beard > He's got a beard.
          They have got the flu > They've got the flu.
          Thus 's here means 'has'.

          Hello Lialia,
          In British English we use haven't you to form this tag question. I think don't you can be used in certain dialects of US English, but I'm not sure, not being from the States myself.

        Regarding question 8, ---- he got a new phone?
        I thought does is the correct answer, cause has is the main verb in the sentence, but I surprised that they used has to ask ? so where is the main verb? and how can we ask using the main verb in the sentence.
        and regarding question 7, what's the difference between the I've and I have ?

          Hi iman1,
          In question 8, actually "got" is the main verb in the sentence, not "has". "Has" is the auxiliary verb. "Got" is the past participle of "get".
          "Does" is used with verbs in the base form, e.g. "get" in this example: Does he get a taxi every day? But, this is not the same meaning as "have got", which shows possession.
          In question 7, I've and I have mean the same thing, but to respond to a question, only the long form is used. (This is also true with other verbs, e.g. We can say Yes, I am or Yes, she is but not Yes, I'm or Yes, she's.)
          I hope that helps.
