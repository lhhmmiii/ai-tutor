        Hallo guys, I want to ask about this question

_____ she's arriving late, she still wants to eat when she gets here.

Why the answer is "Although" .
Because on my view the sentence " she's arriving" (-gerund) should go after despite ot in spite of.

Thank you

          Hello ochaw,
          You're correct that despite and in spite of are followed by -ing forms (gerunds):
          Despite arriving late... / In spite of arriving late...
          However, in this sentence she's arriving is not a gerund. The gerund is an -ing form without any subject or auxiliary verb as in the examples above. Here she's arriving is present continuous (she is arriving). It has a subject (she) and an auxiliary verb (is) before the -ing form.

        Hello,

A: What would your dream home look like?
B: I don't really care, but I want to have an outdoor grill.
A: So, you want to have a grill regardless of your accommodation being a flat, a house, or a hut in the woods.
B: Not a hut, I guess, but regardless of it being a house or a flat.

Can 'regardless accommodation/it being' be used in these sentences?

Thank you

          Hello Tony,
          Yes. Regardless of is followed by an object (since 'of' is a preposition one must follow) and this can be an -ing form. If we want to indicate who the -ing form describes then we can use an object pronoun or (in a rather old-fashioned form) a possessive adjective:
            1. I like him regardless of sometimes being a fool. [here it is the speaker 'I' who is sometimes a fool]
            2. I like him regardless of him sometimes being a fool. [here it is 'him' who is sometimes a fool]
            3. I like him regardless of his sometimes being a fool. [a rather more old-fashioned variant with the same meaning as sentence 2]

          Hello Kasgentle,
          'in spite of' is correct here; you could also say 'despite'. 'even though' has the right meaning, but it's not correct to use a verb in the '-ing' form after 'even though'. Instead, we use a subject + verb. 'I won the race even though I came last in the practice run' would be correct because it has 'I came' instead of 'coming'.
          Does that make sense?
          All the best,
Kirk

            Can I please check which is correct:
            'Despite it being Blue Monday, we were all happy.' or
            'Despite its being Blue Monday, we were all happy.'?
            Thank you for advice.

              Hello Rouane,
              In modern English the form overwhelmingly used in sentences like this is the object pronoun, so it rather than its is standard.
              You can find instances of the possessive adjective (its/his/my etc) being used but this is a form which is disappearing and can sound very formal and old-fashioned.
