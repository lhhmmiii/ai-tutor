  ## Grammar explanation
  Participle clauses enable us to say information in a more economical way. They are formed using present participles (going, reading, seeing, walking, etc.), past participles (gone, read, seen, walked, etc.) or perfect participles (having gone, having read, having seen, having walked, etc.).
  We can use participle clauses when the participle and the verb in the main clause have the same subject. For example,
    Waiting for Ellie, I made some tea. (While I was waiting for Ellie, I made some tea.)
  Participle clauses do not have a specific tense. The tense is indicated by the verb in the main clause.
  Participle clauses are mainly used in written texts, particularly in a literary, academic or journalistic style.
  ### Present participle clauses
  Here are some common ways we use present participle clauses. Note that present participles have a similar meaning to active verbs.
  - To give the result of an action
The bomb exploded, destroying the building.
  - To give the reason for an action
Knowing she loved reading, Richard bought her a book.
  - To talk about an action that happened at the same time as another action
Standing in the queue, I realised I didn't have any money.
  - To add information about the subject of the main clause
Starting in the new year, the new policy bans cars in the city centre.
  ### Past participle clauses
  Here are some common ways that we use past participle clauses. Note that past participles normally have a passive meaning.
  - With a similar meaning to an if condition
Used in this way, participles can make your writing more concise. (If you use participles in this way, … )
  - To give the reason for an action
Worried by the news, she called the hospital.
  - To add information about the subject of the main clause
Filled with pride, he walked towards the stage.
  ### Perfect participle clauses
  Perfect participle clauses show that the action they describe was finished before the action in the main clause. Perfect participles can be structured to make an active or passive meaning.
    Having got dressed, he slowly went downstairs.
Having finished their training, they will be fully qualified doctors.
Having been made redundant, she started looking for a new job.
  ### Participle clauses after conjunctions and prepositions
  It is also common for participle clauses, especially with -ing, to follow conjunctions and prepositions such as before, after, instead of, on, since, when, while and in spite of.
    Before cooking, you should wash your hands. 
Instead of complaining about it, they should try doing something positive.
On arriving at the hotel, he went to get changed.
While packing her things, she thought about the last two years.
In spite of having read the instructions twice, I still couldn’t understand how to use it.

        Hi,
        I would like to ask about the difference in these sentences. Sometimes I'm confused whether to use the present, present perfect or the past participle clause.
        Worried by the news, she called the hospital.
        Being worried by the news, she called the hospital.
        Worrying about the news, she called the hospital.
        Thanks,
        Veronika

          Hi Veronika,
          All options here are grammatically correct.
          The first and the second versions ('Worried by...' and 'Being worried by...') have a passive meaning (she is worried) and both make the causal connection clear: we understand that she called because she was worried. I would say that the first option is the most natural and likely, while the second is less common. It might suit a more formal or a more literary context.
          The third form has an active meaning (she is worrying) and does not make the causal connection explicit. She may be phoning because she is worried, or she may just be worried at the same time as the call. Of course, in this context we are likely to guess that there is a connection but in a different context the two actions may be merely simultaneous and not connected.

        Greetings,
Could somebody please differentiate the participles, gerunds and infinitives so clearly and briefly that no confusion is left?
It's quite baffling!

          Hello SadafWaris,
          Participles and gerunds are both -ing forms. Participles are -ing forms which can have various functions including adjectival and verbal. Gerunds are -ing forms which function as nouns.
          Infinitives are the base forms of verbs. They can be with or without 'to' before them. They are non-finite (they have no tense, person or number).
          You can read more about these forms here:

        I still have a question about present participles, and I’ve come across another example that I don’t fully understand. Could you please help me clarify it?" 

1: Dropping my suit, I dashed downstairs to tell George. 

2: Opening the drawer, he took out a revolver. 

3: hearing the news, she fainted. 

4 : Hearing the phone ring, I picked it up.

          Hello again Froj,
          You certainly have a lot of questions about participles but I think we're now going over old ground with different examples. Since we've already explained quite a few of these, why don't you try to explain them and we'll tell you if you're on the right lines or not? I think that would be useful for you.

            Dear Teacher, I sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding earlier. Could you kindly explain how the present participle is used in various contexts? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could help me understand the difference between sequential and simultaneous actions. Thank you for your guidance.
            I undenstand simultaneously is an actions happening at the same time and you told me but this is sequential actions  so how i can clarify the sequential sentence
            .              Simultaneously 
Walking to school, she was listening to music.
            (Both "walking" and "listening" happen at the same time.)
            So i need to clarify Sequential and how i can clarify this sentence is sequential when i read journal or soclal media or novels etc

        When we see the context this sentence does not mean like reason or we can say ?  But we can read like this method ?

To give the reason for an action
Worried by the news, she called the hospital.

Since or as she worried …….( reason)
        Or we can read like this method
        Filled with pride…..

          Hello again Froj,
          As it says above, sometimes a participle phrase shows actions occurring at the same time and sometimes it shows a causal relationship - the context should make this clear. In your example (Worried by the news...) I think it is clear that there is a causal relationship: she calls the hospital because she is worried by the news.
