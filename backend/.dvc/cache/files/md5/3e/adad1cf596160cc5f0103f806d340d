  ## Grammar explanation
  Used to + infinitive and be/get used to + -ing look similar but they have very different uses.
  ### used to
  We use used to + infinitive to talk about a past situation that is no longer true. It tells us that there was a repeated action or state in the past which has now changed.
    She used to be a long-distance runner when she was younger.
I didn't use to sleep very well, but then I started doing yoga and it really helps.
Did you use to come here as a child?
  ### be used to and get used to
  Be used to means 'be familiar with' or 'be accustomed to'.
    She's used to the city now and doesn't get lost any more.
He wasn't used to walking so much and his legs hurt after the hike.
I'm a teacher so I'm used to speaking in public.
  We use get used to to talk about the process of becoming familiar with something.
    I'm finding this new job hard but I'm sure I'll get used to it soon.
It took my mother years to get used to living in London after moving from Pakistan.
I'm getting used to the noise now. I found it really stressful when I first moved in.
  Be used to and get used to are followed by a noun, pronoun or the -ing form of a verb, and can be used about the past, present or future.

        Hello,
        I would ask you about "used to" and "be used to and get used to".
        Although I have figured out the concept, I struggle hard to remember the difference between ‚Äúused to‚Äù and ‚Äúbe used to and get used to‚Äù mainly because of the different structure they have:
        *used to + infinitive to talk about a past situation that is no longer true
*used to and get used to are followed by a noun, pronoun or the -ing form of a verb.
        Every time I have to review the concept, the structure and I can't keep it in my mind.
        I have always practiced it, but as soon as I move on to another topic, it is as if I meet that structure for the first time.
        Please, do you have any advice abou that?
        Thank you.

          Hello User_1,
          Different people find different techniques helpful for memorisation. I suggest trying a range of things to see what works for you. Sometimes (this is my technique) just writing things down is very helpful. The act of writing something out on paper can really implant it in the memory.
          As far as the language goes, I would separate used to + verb from the other two as it describes a past habit which is no longer true and is best learned as a way of talking about the past - as an alternative to past tense.
          You can try to remember get used to and be used to as two steps: There is a new situation and you need to get used to it (the process). It's hard but once you succeed you can say now you are used to it (the result).

        Hello sir. 
Please help me by answering my question. 
1.Can we use  'can, could, may, might, shall, will' with 'get used to' like:
I may get used to it. 
I can get used to it. 
He should get used to it. 
He will get used to it. 
??
        My second question is-
Do i write sentence (below) right... 
I have been used to eating noodle daily. 
My third question is-
He used not to speak the truth (here 'used to' is used as auxiliary verb?) 
He didn't use to speak the truth(here 'used to' is used as main verb?)

          Hello sartaj,
            1.Can we use  'can, could, may, might, shall, will' with 'get used to' like:
I may get used to it. 
I can get used to it. 
He should get used to it. 
He will get used to it.
          Yes, those are all perfectly fine.
            Do i write sentence (below) right... 
I have been used to eating noodle daily.
          No. You can say 'I am used to...' (still true) or 'I was used to...' (no longer true). If you want to talk about a change in what you are used to then use 'get used to' as in 'I have got used to eating....'
            He used not to speak the truth (here 'used to' is used as auxiliary verb?) 
He didn't use to speak the truth(here 'used to' is used as main verb?)
          Both negative forms are possible. You can negative 'used to' (as in the second sentence) to mean that this was not his habit in the past or you can negate the infinitive ('to not...' or 'not to...') to mean his habit was not doing this. In most contexts the forms are interchangeable in most contexts. Sometimes there is a subtle distinction:
          He didn't use to like horror films. [now he likes them]
          He used to not like horror films. [now he no longer dislikes them]

            Thank you very much sir. It helps a lot.
            Two another questions-
            As we use the structures (be said to+infinitive)...
            Can you give me examples of 'be said to+infinitive' in present, past and future?
            Second question-
            The structure (be to+infinitive) is only used for future and not for present and past? And please give me some examples of this structure for future, present and past?

              Hello again sartaj,
              You can simply change the form of be in be said to if you want to describe when the opinion is held:
              She is said to be a very rich woman.
              She was said to be a very rich woman.
              She will be said to be a very rich woman.
              You can also make the sentence refer to a fact in the past, present or future:
              She is said to have been a very rich woman.
              She is said to be a very rich woman.
              She is said to be going to be a very rich woman.
              As you can see, the structure is not limited to any particular time reference.

                My second question is not answered.
                The form 'Be to+infinitive' is only used for future time reference?
                And please give me some examples of this structure?

                  Hello again sartaj,
                  The structure be + to verb has a future meaning but it can future as seen from the past. For example:
                  He is to finish the project this week. [present obligation to do something in the future]
                  He was to finish it last week. [past obligation to do something in the future then]
                  The latter of these may or may not imply that the obligation was met:
                  He was to finish it last week but he didn't!
                  He was to finish it last week so I'm sure it's ready.

                    Hello again dear teacher üñê
                    Can we use various kinds of infinitives in "Be +to verb" Construction?
                    And can we use 'be going to' in this construction?
                    Please give me some examples of this. It will be more helpful for me.
                    Thank you.
