  ## Grammar explanation
  We use different verb forms to talk about our plans for the future, depending on what kind of plan it is: a spontaneous plan, a pre-decided plan or an arrangement.
  ### will
  We use will to talk about spontaneous plans decided at the moment of speaking.
    Oops, I forgot to phone Mum! I'll do it after dinner. 
I can't decide what to wear tonight. I know! I'll wear my green shirt.
There's no milk. I'll buy some when I go to the shops.
  ### going to
  We use going to to talk about plans decided before the moment of speaking.
    I'm going to phone Mum after dinner. I told her I'd call at 8 o'clock.
I'm going to wear my black dress tonight. 
I'm going to go to the supermarket after work. What do we need?
  ### Present continuous
  We usually use the present continuous when the plan is an arrangement – already confirmed with at least one other person and we know the time and place.
    I'm meeting Jane at 8 o'clock on Saturday. 
We're having a party next Saturday. Would you like to come?
  We often use the present continuous to ask about people's future plans.

        Hi Jonathan,
        On this page, it is said that we usually use the present continuous when the plan is an arrangement – already confirmed with at least one other person and we know the time and place.
        However, the example cited in my grammar book reads as follows :
        - What are you doing tonight ?         -- I'm washing my hair.
        [1] Do you think the use of the present continuous in the answer "I'm washing my hair" is grammatically correct ?
        The answer doesn't indicate that I've made an arrangement with anybody. Washing my hair this evening is just my personal plan. It doesn't conform to the definition on this page anyway.
        [2] Or, can we use the present continuous for our personal fixed plans that don't involve an arrangement with another person, such as :  I'm writing letters tonight ?
        I would appreciate your explanation.
        Best regards,

          Hello melvinthio,
          Generally, arrangements involve other people. However, we also use present continuous for plans which we see as already fixed and which we do not expect to change. That is the case with your example. The answer to your questions, therefore, is 1. yes and 2. yes.

            Hello Peter  i have read the example of Mr melvinthio and i think it is meant to express the present not the future because the question is " what are you doing tonight" not "tomorrow night "  so using the present continous is the correct form i guess ; so there is no need to compare it with making arrangement in the future .

              Hello Rofi,
              'What are you doing tonight?' is a question we would ask before the time. For example, we might ask it in the morning or the afternoon. If it were already evening or night we would ask 'What are you doing now?' or "What are you doing at the moment?'. The question is about the future and about the other person's plans or arrangements.

        Hello there...
        What is the difference between two sentences below?
        1.I am missing you.
        2.I miss you.
        Please make this clear sir.

          Hello sartaj,
          The first sentence (I am missing) suggests a temporary situation: what the speaker is feeling right now. The second sentence (I miss) suggests something more general, long-term or even permanent. However, the difference in this context is slight and more a question of how the speaker perceives his or her feelings than any objective factual meaning.

            Thank you dear sir for the answer.
            I have another question.
            Model verbs(may, might,) are used for past, present and future?
            Thank you.

              Hello sartaj,
              May and might can both refer to present and future when followed by a bare infinitive:
                He might be from the UK, I'm not sure.
                It might rain tomorrow.
              To talk about the past we use a perfect infinitive after them:
                He might have arrived already. Let's check.

                Thank you dear sir.
                Have one more question related to model verbs.
                Would, could and should are used to refer to past only?

                  Hello again sartaj,
                  No, in fact these modals most often have a present or future time reference. Of course, it's important to see them in context to make the meaning clear.
